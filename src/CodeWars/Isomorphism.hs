module CodeWars.Isomorphism where

import Data.Void
-- A type of `Void` have no value.
-- So it is impossible to construct `Void`,
-- unless using undefined, error, unsafeCoerce, infinite recursion, etc
-- And there is a function
-- absurd :: Void -> a
-- That get any value out of `Void`
-- We can do this becuase we can never have void in the zeroth place.

-- so, when are two type, `a` and `b`, considered equal?
-- a definition might be, it is possible to go from `a` to `b`,
-- and from `b` to `a`.
-- Going a roundway trip should leave you the same value.
-- Unfortunately it is virtually impossible to test this in Haskell.
-- This is called Isomorphism.

-- Is the same as the original value.
-- You need this to prove some case are impossible.

-- We cannot have
-- isoUnEither :: ISO (Either a b) (Either c d) -> ISO a c -> ISO b d.
-- Note that we have
isoEU :: ISO (Either [()] ()) (Either [()] Void)
isoEU = error "do isoEU"
-- where (), the empty tuple, has 1 value, and Void has 0 value
-- If we have isoUnEither,
-- We have ISO () Void by calling isoUnEither isoEU
-- That is impossible, since we can get a Void by substL on ISO () Void
-- So it is impossible to have isoUnEither

-- And we have isomorphism on isomorphism!
